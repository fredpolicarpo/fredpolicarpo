I'm a really experienced developer with strong engineering skills and also relevant soft skills. 

I'm very focused on being aligned with the company's/product's goals, and I always try to find out the best balance between being pragmatic delivering fast, and being cautious by applying the best engineering approaches to ensure quality in the long term for the whole product life cycle.
