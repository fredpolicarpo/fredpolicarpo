## Draft
I've been building a risk-platform service that evaluates 50K/day applications using a lot of third-party integrations like bureaus and risk-analysis services, in a system strongly based on DDD, and event-driven with Kafka. That is very challenging due to different third parties requiring special error handling and also dealing with reactive/event-driven systems require a lot of care to keep the system consistent working with great resilience. This project is very important for the company as it has as the outcome flag customers as secure or not, so we directly affect the company cash.

I have a mature notion of ownership in a way where I get involved since the idea about what we need to do to solve the user's problem, until monitor and operate the delivery after it got to production.

I've been developed a clear and confident communication with all stakeholders and team, so I've been naturally recognized with a Team leader and I can work properly close to manager/directors/C levels in order to help to improve the engineering culture in a way to have fast delivery balanced with long-term thought about the company main goals. These communication skills are based on agile methodologies that I've been worked with like Scrum, XP, ShapeUp, and Kanban. 

I'm very pragmatic so I always build a set of tools and strategies to develop fast and with the proper quality to solve the real problems that the companies and products require.
