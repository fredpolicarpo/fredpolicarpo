## Draft
I've built a risk-platform service that evaluates 50K/day applications with some third-party integrations like bureaus and risk-analysis services, in a system strongly based on DDD, and event-driven with Kafka.

I have a mature notion of ownership in a way where I get involved since the idea about what we need to do to solve the user's problem, until monitor and operate the delivery after it got to production.

I've been developed a clear and confident communication with all stakeholders and team, so I've been naturally recognized with a Team leader and I can work properly close to manager/directors/C levels in order to help to improve the engineering culture in a way to have fast delivery balanced with long-term thought about the company main goals. These communication skills are based on agile methodologies that I've been worked with like Scrum, XP, ShapeUp, and Kanban. 

I'm very pragmatic so I always build a set of tools and strategies to develop fast and with the proper quality to solve the real problems that the companies and products require.
