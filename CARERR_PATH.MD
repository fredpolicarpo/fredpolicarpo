I've been done a lot of work experience in small, medium and big companies, mainly working on the B.E of distributed systems with a high volume of processing.
I feel confident to work on building an enterprise engineer culture and defining software architecture to a new product, as well.
As I've been done some leading I know that I'm a good professional to lead an engineering team, in a hands-on way, and to design a system considering the full life cycle of a product, from the user pain, until the operation/monitoring of the system.
